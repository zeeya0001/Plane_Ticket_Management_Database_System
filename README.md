19. after whole process our app is completed now, so, if anyone want to test it.

    here's the precedure to run the app:
    1. open the vs code or any other code editor and open the directory in which you want to work.
    2. open terminal manually or press "ctrl + shift + `"
    3. Follow the command:
    4. git clone https://github.com/zeeya0001/Plane_Ticket_Management_Database_System.git
    5. cd Plane_Ticket_Management_Database_System
    6. Create a new virtual environment
    7. Create a new virtual environment using the virtualenv command (or python -m venv for Python 3.3+):
    8. For Python 2: virtualenv myenv
    9. For Python 3.3+: python -m venv myenv
    10. This will create a new directory called myenv (or the name you specified) containing a Python executable and other dependencies.
    11. Activate the virtual environment
    12. **For Linux/MacOS:**
    13. source myenv/bin/activate
    14. **For Windows:**
    15. myenv\Scripts\activate
    16. Your terminal/command prompt should now indicate that youâ€™re working in the virtual environment (e.g., (myenv)).
    17. python app_runner.py

       Now, the app server will be started running at port 4000,
       open any browser and type this url: localhost:4000
